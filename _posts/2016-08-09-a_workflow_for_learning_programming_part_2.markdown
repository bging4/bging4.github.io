## Remember the Simple Things with Spaced Repetition


In the first part of this series I talked about dealing with confusion. This confusion usually comes when you’re struggling to understand a fundamental concept, or its application. But not everything is challenging on a deep, conceptual level. Some things just require memorization.

There are are plenty of methods to boost your memory out there. The important thing is to create a habit and stick to it. Spaced repetition software is extremely helpful here, as it takes care of many things for you, letting you focus your mental energy on practicing your recall, not managing your review system.

I use Anki, an excellent spaced repetition flashcard program.  There are other ones out there, but Anki is simple and flexible. It’s available on all mobile formats, as far as I am aware, so you can review wherever you might be. This is not only convenient, but recalling things in different locations and context has been shown to strengthen your memory.

There is really no limit to what you can turn into a flashcard. Obviously method definitions and syntax are good choices, as they often involve pure memorization. But you can also ask yourself questions to enhance your recall of key concepts. 

A word of caution: spaced repetition works best when you already understand the underlying concept. It can strengthen your associations, but it is pretty much useless trying to memorize something before you fully understand it.
